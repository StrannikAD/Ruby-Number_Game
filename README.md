### Ruby - Number_Game

##### Using variables, strings, method calls, conditional and loops I wrote a number guessing game in Ruby - with less than 30 lines of code!

To play the game, simply type in `ruby get_number.rb` into your terminal.

* Prompt the player to enter their name. Use their name to print a greeting.
* Generate a random number from 1 to 100, and store it as a target number for the player to guess. 
* Keep track of how many guesses the player has made. Before each guess, let them know how many guesses (out of 10) they have left.
* Prompt the player to make a guess as to what the target number is.
* Keep allowing the player to guess until they get it right or run out of turns.
